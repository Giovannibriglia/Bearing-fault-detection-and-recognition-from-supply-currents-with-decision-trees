# Bearing-fault-detection-and-recognition-from-supply-currents-with-decision-trees
This repository corresponds to the research paper titled "Bearing Fault Detection and Recognition from Supply Currents with Decision Trees", authored by Giovanni Briglia, Fabio Immovilli, Marco Cocconcelli, and Marco Lippi.

In this paper we consider the tasks of detecting and recognizing bearing faults in electric motors from the signals collected from supply currents, using machine learning techniques. In particular, following recent trends in AI, we are interested in interpretable solutions that provide explanations on the decisions taken by the classifiers.
For this reason, we resort to decision trees, a classic machine learning approach which inductively learns tree structures from a collection of observations. Paths along the learnt trees can be easily interpreted as plain classification rules. An extensive experimental comparison shows the strong generalization capabilities of such a classifier. In particular, we report results obtained in a highly challenging scenario, usually overlooked in the literature, where the system is tested on configurations of radial and torsional loads that have not been observed during training.
